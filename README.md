Welcome to Chatbot repository! This project aims to develop a chatbot that provides accurate and helpful answers to questions about our courses. With this chatbot, students, prospective students, and faculty members can easily obtain information about various courses offered by the university.

The goal is to improve the accessibility and efficiency of course-related information, reducing the need for manual search and providing instant responses to common queries. This chatbot uses natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user questions effectively.
